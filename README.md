TechTalk will be a desktop and Android-based programme that instructs students in the manner of a professional instructor.
To manipulate data and operate devices, an Android application will be used.
Weekly assessments and regular quizzes on current themes will be given to students to help them understand the material better.
To keep consumers' interest or to entertain them when they're bored, there will be a game session.
